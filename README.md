# link-cue

Cue links in a queue.

## background
I always end up with a ton of links open. I open a tab to read later, and then another, and another.

I could bookmark them sure, but there's 2 issues with that:
1. No way to see what I've read and what I haven't (unless I'm dilligent about deleting read bookmarks)
2. No ordering. Usually they're oldest to newest or alphabetical, but that doesn't really show what you should go to next.

Really, this is just a more restrictive bookmark tool.
